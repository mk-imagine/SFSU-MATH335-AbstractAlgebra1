\begin{enumerate}

 
 \item Complete the second exploration problem (EP2) for your final project.  (Remember, these problems are listed at the end of the Final Project Guidelines.)  Please write which project you're working on at the top of the page, for my reference.

\item Let
\[H = \{ e, \; (1,2)(3,4)\} \subseteq S_4,\]
where $e$ denotes the identity permutation.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\noindent (a) Show that $H$ is not a normal subgroup of $S_4$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent (b) Consider the following three elements of $S_4$:
\[\alpha = (2,4,3), \;\; \beta = (1,4,2), \;\;\; \gamma = (1,3,2).\]
Show that $\alpha H = \beta H$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent (c) Show that $(\alpha \circ \gamma) H \neq (\beta \circ \gamma) H$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent (d) What do parts (b) and (c) show?

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Let $G= \text{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ be the group of all $2 \times 2$ invertible matrices with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}$, and let
\[H = \left\{ \left. \left(\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ 0 & d \end{array}\right) \; \right| \; ad \neq 0 \right\} \subseteq G.\]
Is $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$?  Prove your answer.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Let $\varphi: G\rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism of groups.  Prove that $\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$.
