\begin{enumerate}

 
 \item Complete the third exploration problem (EP3) for your final project.  (Remember, these problems are listed at the end of the Final Project Guidelines.)  Please write which project you're working on at the top of the page, for my reference.
 
\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism.  Prove that $\text{im}(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $H$.  (Recall, to do this, we need to check that $\text{im}(\varphi)$ is closed, that it contains the identity element, and that it contains inverses of all of its elements.)

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism.  Prove that $\text{ker}(\varphi)$ is a {\it normal} subgroup of $G$.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\item This problem concerns the group $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$, whose elements are pairs of integers $(a,b)$, under the operation
\[(a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b + d).\]

\vspace{0.25cm}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the identity element of $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$?

\vspace{0.25cm}

\item Let $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the homomorphism
\[\varphi(a,b) = a-b.\]
What is the kernel of $\varphi$?  To what familiar group is $\text{ker}(\varphi)$ isomorphic?

\vspace{0.25cm}

\item What is the image of $\varphi$?

\vspace{0.25cm}

\item What does the First Isomorphism Theorem say in this case?
